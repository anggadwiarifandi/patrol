title: Native Automation 2.0 (Native2)
---

<Info>
Native2 is available starting from Patrol version `3.6.0`.

## What is native2?

Native2 was created to address fundamental limitations in the original native automation approach. The original native API was primarily designed for Android, and attempts to make a single `Selector` work across both platforms proved problematic because:

- **Platform-specific identifiers**: iOS and Android use different identifier systems (Android's `resourceName` vs iOS's `identifier`)
- **Flaky text selectors**: Text-based selectors can be unreliable as they may change with localization or UI updates
- **Platform incompatibility**: A single selector approach couldn't effectively handle the fundamental differences between iOS and Android element identification

Native2 provides a **single command** that can work with both Android and iOS selectors, eliminating the need to write separate platform-specific code. Instead of maintaining different methods for each platform, you can now use one method that accepts platform-specific selectors that acknowledge the inherent differences between platforms.


### Before native2 (Separate Methods)

```dart
// You were forced to use flaky text-based selectors that work on both platforms
await $.native.tap(Selector(textContains: 'Login'));
```

```dart
// Before: Sometimes you needed to use platform-specific if statements in your test code.
if (Platform.isAndroid) {
  await $.native.tap(Selector(resourceId: 'com.android.camera2:id/shutter_button'));
} else {
  await $.native.tap(Selector(label: 'Take Picture'));
}
```

### With native2

Native2 provides a single method that works across both platforms:

```dart
// After: Single method with platform-specific selectors
await $.native2.tap(
  NativeSelector(
    android: AndroidSelector(
      resourceName: 'com.android.camera2:id/shutter_button',
    ),
    ios: IOSSelector(label: 'Take Picture'),
  ),
);

// Text input with unified method
await $.native2.enterText(
  NativeSelector(
    android: AndroidSelector(
      contentDescription: 'Email field',
    ),
    ios: IOSSelector(
      identifier: 'emailField',
    ),
  ),
  text: 'john@example.com',
);
```

### Text Input Operations

```dart
// Enter password in secure field
await $.native2.enterText(
  NativeSelector(
    android: AndroidSelector(
      contentDescription: 'Password',
    ),
    ios: IOSSelector(
      elementType: IOSElementType.secureTextField,
    ),
  ),
  text: 'secretpassword',
);
```

### More platform-specific attributes like elementType for iOS

```dart
// Find elements by instance (when multiple elements match)
await $.native2.tap(
  NativeSelector(
    android: AndroidSelector(
      className: 'android.widget.Button',
      instance: 2, // Third button (0-indexed)
    ),
    ios: IOSSelector(
      elementType: IOSElementType.button,
      instance: 2, // Third button (0-indexed)
    ),
  ),
);
```

### Specifying App ID (iOS)

When working with iOS, you may need to specify the `appId` parameter to interact with elements in specific applications. This is particularly useful when your test needs to interact with system apps like Safari, Settings, or other third-party applications.

<Info>
The `appId` parameter is primarily needed for iOS. On Android, the app context is usually handled automatically.

```dart
await $.native2.tap(
  appId: 'com.apple.mobilesafari',
  NativeSelector(
    ios: IOSSelector(elementType: IOSElementType.button, label: 'Open'),
  ),
);
```
